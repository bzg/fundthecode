/Fund the code/ is about *funding* Free and Open Source Softwares during
*live events*.

/Fund the code/ Organizers gather sponsors, FOSS maintainers and a
general audience.  The money from the sponsors is distributed to the
audience who donate it back to maintainers after they present their
projects.

It is a nice way to support free software projects, to interact with
core developers and to sensibilize everyone about the need for better
sustainability in FOSS.

Previous events (2013, 2014 and 2015) where called [[https://hackadon.org/][Hackadons]].
