Fund The Code is about *funding* Free and Open Source Softwares during *live events*.

Fund The Code Organizers gather sponsors, FOSS maintainers and a
general audience.  The money from the sponsors is distributed to the
audience who donate it back to maintainers after they present their
projects.

It is a nice way to support Free and Open-Source projects, to meet
with developers and to sensibilise everyone about the need for better
sustainability in FOSS.

Previous events where called "[[https://hackadon.org/][Hackadon]]".
